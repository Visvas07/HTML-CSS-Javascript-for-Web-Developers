			Loaded with veggies, crunchy cashews, warm spices like saffron, herbs like cilantro and mint, this biryani is a delight to the taste buds in every bite!Biryani is a rice dish made with layers of rice, spices and traditionally meat (but it our case veggies!).

			Here are the key components of biryani:

			Rice: of course rice is the base and key ingredient of this dish. Long grain basmati rice is what is traditionally used.
			Veggies: so traditionally meat is used in biryani but since we are making veg biryani, we are using assorted vegetables here.Potato, cauliflower, beans and carrots are often used.You can use green peas, mushrooms or even paneer would be a good addition.
			Spices: aromatic and exotic spices  (both whole and ground) are a must for a good biryani. Most commonly used are cardamom, peppercorns, cumin, saffron, garam masala.Also rose water or kewra water is often used to flavor the biryani.
			Fresh herbs & nuts: herbs like mint, cilantro and nuts like cashews are often added as garnishing and to add more texture and flavors to the biryani.Caramelized onions also make a great addition.
			The veggies and rice are layered and the biryani is then cooked on low heat with some heavy object placed on top of the pot of biryani.This process is called “dum” and hence it’s also known as Vegetable Dum Biryani.<a href="#">(Go back)</a>

		<h2 id="r2" class="text-center">Naan</h2><br><p>
			Naan needs no introduction, it is the most popular Indian bread in the western world for sure.Most of the Americans that I talk to think Indian food=naan and curry.It is rather amusing that how the Indian food is perceived here<br>
			Naan is a leavened bread made using all purpose flour. It is extremely popular in the Indian subcontinent.<br>
			Naan is made with basic ingredients like flour, oil, yeast, milk. One can also make naan without yeast but I prefer the version with yeast.You can either cook the naan in a tandoor (clay oven, often used by Indian restaurants) or bake them in the oven.<br> naan requires basic pantry ingredients.

				Flour: I use 100% all purpose flour, that’s what is traditionally used in making naan.If you want to use whole wheat flour, I would recommend using 50% whole wheat and 50% all purpose.Don’t replace the entire flour with whole wheat else the bread will be dense.
					<br>
				Yeast: it is very important to use a good quality yeast here. Trust me, it makes a difference.<br>
				Oil: you can use any flavorless oil here. Avocado oil, canola oil, vegetable oil they all work.
				Yogurt: I use plain milk yogurt here, I haven’t tested the recipe with almond milk yogurt but I think it should work.
					<br>
				Milk  
				Butter: and of course a good naan to be brushed with butter once done.
				So, from the ingredients list it is pretty obvious that you don’t require any fancy ingredients for naan.It is one of those things that you can easily make at home and this recipe will make sure you succeed in making them perfectly each time.			<a href="#">(Go back)</a>

		<h2 id="r3" class="text-center">Panner Butter Masala</h2><br><p>
			To make this paneer butter masala recipe, we start with boiling the tomatoes, onion, cashews, ginger and garlic.
			This forms the base sauce. Once the ingredients are boiled, they are pureed and then rest of the ingredients (including paneer) are added to the dish.A lot of people use only tomatoes for making paneer butter masala or paneer makhani. You can do the same if you like.Adding some white/sweet onions will get the extra flavor but it will taste just as good with the tomatoes too.Remember to not use red onions here. A lot of times they have a very strong flavor and that will affect the final taste of the dish.So, stick to the white or sweet onions for this dish.<a href="#">(Go back)</a>
